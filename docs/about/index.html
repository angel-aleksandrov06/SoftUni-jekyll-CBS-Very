                The main objective of CBS-Very is to provide quality tuition to students so that the joy of dance may be experienced. The teaching environment is warm, friendly and encouraging and many students have remained with the school from its outset to the present, some going on to full-time and tertiary dance courses.
                Classes aim to challenge students and the content is presented in an interesting format appropriate to the particular age and level. Children in "Minjons" level enjoy a mixture of dance games and basic technique while "Juniors" level are guided through a more formal class structure. Props and inspiring music form an important part of the learning process.
